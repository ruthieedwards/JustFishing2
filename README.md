Originally made for [a 48-hour game jam](https://ldjam.com/) in December 2017 under the theme, "the more you have, the worse it is." Written in HaxeFlixel, optimized for Flash and HTML5 targets. 
This is an overhauled version with tons of new content: 3 fishing spots, an overworld map, 5 music tracks, and 28 fish.

The game is designed to be universally accessible:
- Descriptive audio including voiceovers
- One-button control
- Sandbox-style play with no QTEs or timers


#### Tools used
- Framework: HaxeFlixel
- Art: Aseprite
- Music: WolframTones
- SFX: Bfxr / Adobe Audition


#### Bugs
- **HTML5:** Audio is finicky across browsers. More: [HTML Media Compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility)
- **HTML5:** Audio does not work on iOS. Probably an issue with Safari disabling autoplay.
