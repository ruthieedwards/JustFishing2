Originally made for [a 48-hour game jam](https://ldjam.com/) in December 2017 under the theme, "the more you have, the worse it is." Written in HaxeFlixel, optimized for Flash and HTML5 targets. 
This is an overhauled version with tons of new content: 3 fishing spots, an overworld map, 5 music tracks, and 28 fish.
